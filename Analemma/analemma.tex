    Everything is vague to a degree you do not
    realize till you have tried to make it precise
}{Bertrand Russell, \\\textit{The Philosophy of Logical Atomism}}

What is noon? This trivial question hides a reality unsuspected at first glance.
Any sensible person would tell you that noon is when their clock shows 12:00. 
Someone a bit more erudite could answer that noon is when the sun reaches its 
highest point in the sky. Are these two definitions equivalent?

Well, obviously, with the advent of time zones, the answer is no.
But even at Greenwich, located right on the meridian, the two are close but 
do not match! Sometimes by 15 minutes! This is known at least since 
Ptolemy, the Greek astronomer, mathematician and geographer who lived in the 
2nd century.

Let us look in figure \ref{fig:sunrise_sunset} at the sunrise and sunset times 
on the top of \textit{Monte Perdido} in the Pyrenees, located at 42°40'N, 
00°02'E, very close to the meridian. 
Noon is computed as the average of sunrise and sunset times, and as expected, 
it is near 13:00 in winter (CET+1) and near 14:00 in summer (CEST+2). 
But if we zoom in on the data, we see that noon is not constant! It varies by
more than 30 minutes over the year. And this is independent of the latitude!

Defining day length as the time between consecutive noons, we would find that
it is not constant either and by extension, the hours, minutes and 
seconds would change from day to day... This is the definition of 
\textit{apparent solar time}, which is the time measured by a sundial. Low-tech,
but not very practical in our organized society.

Instead, we prefer to use the \textit{mean solar day} which matches the sun's 
average rate of motion over the year. It is simply defined as $86\,400$ seconds,
give or take a few cosmic crumbs that are not our business today.

\begin{figure}[ht]

        time [data from \texttt{TimeAndDate}].
    }
    \label{fig:sunrise_sunset}
\end{figure}

Then, the natural question is: where is the sun at 12:00 if it is not at its 
highest point? We will answer this question by digging into the math and physics
at play, and discover the beautiful figure drawn by the sun: the analemma.

Someone actually did this experiment and recorded the sun's position
throughout the year 
[\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deli5COMJhs}{timelapse link}].


\newpage
The analemma depends on three parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the Earth's axial tilt $\epsilon$;
    \item the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit $e$;
    \item the time shift $\sigma$ between the winter solstice and the perihelion.
\end{itemize}
To understand why, let's proceed step by step, starting without any of these
parameters.

We should also note that latitude and longitude only translate the analemma
to a different position in the sky, but do not change its shape.

For simplicity, let's furthermore suppose that the year is exactly $N=365$ solar 
days of $T_d = 86400=24\times 60\times 60$ seconds. This is obviously inacurate, 
but sufficent to reveal the beauty of the phenomenon at play.

The Earth (E) is revolving counterclockwise around the sun (S) in a circular 
orbit of radius $a$, with angular velocity $\dot \phi=\Omega$.
An observer (O) is rotating counterclockwise around the Earth's axis at a 
distance $R$ with angular velocity $\dot \theta=\omega$.

The night sky completes a full rotation to an Earth-based observer in just 
under 24 hours. The extra $\sim 4$ minutes account for the fact that, during 
that time, the Earth also moves slightly along its orbit around the sun - by
about $2\pi/N$ radians. As a result, Earth must rotate a bit more for the 
Sun to return to the same position in the sky.

This period is called the \textit{sidereal day}, noted here $T_s$. 
We experience $N$ solar days in a year, but the Earth actually completes $N+1$ 
sidereal days in the same time.
\begin{align}
    \dot\phi = \Omega = \frac{2\pi}{N T_d} \qquad\qquad
    \dot\theta = \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T_s} = (N+1) \Omega
\end{align}

We want to find the position of the sun at a given time $t$ in the Earth's 
frame:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \overrightarrow{OS} &= \overrightarrow{OE} + \overrightarrow{ES}\\
        &= -R \mathrm{y}_1 - a \mathrm{x}_1\\
        &= -R \mathrm{y}_1 - a \Big[\cos(\phi-\theta) \mathrm{y}_1 + \sin(\phi-\theta) \mathrm{y}_2\Big].
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Since $R/a \approx 4\times 10^{-5}$, we can neglect the term $R y_1$. 
From here on, we will use the direction vector 
$s\approx \overrightarrow{OS}/\|\overrightarrow{OS}\|$ that neglects
the $R$ term. Rewriting $\phi-\theta$, we then get:
\begin{align}
    s(t) &= -\Big[\cos(2\pi t/T_d) \mathrm{y}_1 + \sin(2\pi t/T_d) \mathrm{y}_2\Big],\\
    s(t_{12}) &= \mathrm{y}_1.
\end{align}
where $t_{12}=T_d/2 + kT_d$ is the time of 12:00 on day $k$.

The Earth's axis is tilted by an angle $\epsilon=23.44^\circ$ with respect to
the ecliptic plane. The basis $[\mathrm{y}]$ attached to the Earth's frame is 
now obtained after two rotations: first by $\epsilon$ around the $\mathrm{I}_2$ 
axis, then by $\theta$ around the third axis:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}[c]
        [ \mathrm{y} ] &= R_3(\theta) R_2(\epsilon) [\mathrm{I}] \\
        [ \mathrm{x} ] &= R_3(\phi) R_2(-\epsilon) R_3(-\theta)[\mathrm{y}].
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The sun's position in the Earth's frame $[\mathrm{y}]$ is now given by:
\begin{equation}
    s = -\mathrm{x}_1 =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -\cos(\phi)\cos(\epsilon)\cos(\theta) - \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\\
        \phantom{+}\cos(\phi)\cos(\epsilon)\sin(\theta)-\sin(\phi) \cos(\theta)\\
        -\cos(\phi)\sin(\epsilon)\phantom{\sin(\theta)+\sin(\phi) \cos(\theta)}
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where is the sun at 12:00?}

Once again, we insert $t_{12}=kT_d+T_d/2$ for $k=0,1,2,\ldots N-1$ in $s$ to 
derive the sun's position at noon. First let's express the angles $\phi$ and 
$\theta$ in terms of $k$:
\begin{equation}
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        \phi &= \Omega t_{12} = 2\pi \frac{1}{N} (k+\tfrac{1}{2})\\
        \theta &= \omega t_{12} = 2\pi \frac{N+1}{N} (k+\tfrac{1}{2})
    \end{aligned}
    \right\} \implies
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        \phi-\theta &= -N\phi = -2\pi (k+\tfrac{1}{2})\\
        \phi+\theta &= (N+2)\phi = 2\pi k + \pi + 2\cdot 2\pi \frac{k+\tfrac{1}{2}}{N}
    \end{aligned}
    \right\}.
\end{equation}

Using trigonometric identities, we find
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \cos(\phi)\cos(\theta)\vert_{12:00} &= -\cos^2\left(2\pi \frac{k+1/2}{N}\right)\\
        \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\vert_{12:00} &= -\sin^2\left(2\pi \frac{k+1/2}{N}\right)\\
        \cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)\vert_{12:00} &= -\frac{1}{2} \sin(2\cdot 2\pi \frac{k+1/2}{N})
        = \sin(\phi)\cos(\theta)\vert_{12:00}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With these, we can express the analemma as a parametric curve with parameter 
$\beta \in [0,2\pi]$:
\begin{equation}
    s\vert_{12:00}(\beta) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos(\epsilon)\cos^2(\beta) + \sin^2(\beta)\\
        \tfrac{1}{2}(1-\cos(\epsilon)) \sin(2\beta)\\
        -\sin(\epsilon) \cos(\beta)
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

This curve is shown in figure \ref{fig:analemma_easy} for various 
tilt angles $\epsilon$, in the observer's frame, that is, without the 
$\mathrm{y}_1$ component.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./analemma_plot.pdf}
    \caption{

        horizon of the observer. Each month has been associated to a specific 
        color.
    }
    \label{fig:analemma_easy}
\end{figure}


\textbf{When is the sun at its highest point?}

First, we'll determine the time $t$ when the sun is at its highest point in the
sky, which is when the vector $\mathrm{x}_1$ has no $\mathrm{y}_2$ component 
(midnight is also a solution):
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \cos(\Omega t)\sin\big((N+1)\Omega t\big) \cos(\epsilon) &= \sin(\Omega t) \cos\big((N+1)\Omega t\big)\\
        \iff \quad \sin(N\Omega t)(1-c \cos^2(\Omega t)) &= \frac{c}{2} \cos(N\Omega t) \sin(2\Omega t)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c=1-\cos(\epsilon)$. This equation has no closed form solution for $t^*$,
but we can approximate it around 12:00 with $t^*=kT_d+T_d/2+\delta$, $k=0,1,2\ldots N-1$
:
\begin{equation}
    \left\{
        \begin{aligned}
            \sin(N\Omega t^*) &= -\sin(2\pi\delta / T_d)\\
            \cos(N\Omega t^*) &= -\cos(2\pi\delta / T_d)\\
            \sin(2\Omega t^*) &\approx \sin\big(\tfrac{2\pi}{N} (1+2k)\big)\\
            \cos(\Omega t^*) &\approx \cos\big(\tfrac{\:\pi\:}{N} (1+2k)\big)\\
        \end{aligned}
    \right\} \; \implies \;
    \frac{2\pi \delta}{T_d} \approx \tan(\frac{2\pi \delta}{T_d}) = 
    \frac{c}{2} \frac{\sin(2\cdot 2\pi \tfrac{k+0.5}{N})}{1-c \cos^2(2\pi \tfrac{k+0.5}{N})}.
    \label{eq:noon_shift}
\end{equation}
Noon is off by $\delta$ seconds from the mean solar time, and this shift
oscillates twice a year as demonstrated by the factor at the numerator of 
\eqref{eq:noon_shift} and shown in figure \ref{fig:noon_shift}. 
The approximation can be simplified with $\tan(x) \approx x$ 
("approx. 2") and even further by removing the denominator ("approx. 3").

\textbf{An intuitive explanation}

If we consider the Earth's rotating frame,
the sun is revolving around the earth, but also moving up 
(winter and spring) and down (autumn and summer) its equatorial plane.

This vertical motion has a period of one year: the sun reaches its highest point
at the summer solstice, and its lowest point at the winter solstice, for people 
in the northern hemisphere. Since the sun's total motion is constant, its
horizontal motion must slow down when the vertical motion is at its highest 
\textit{in absolute value}. 

The sun's eastward velocity is thus at its highest
at both solstices, and at its lowest at both equinoxes, producing a
motion of period half a year. The sun's horizontal position is simply the
integral of this velocity as we can see in figure 
\ref{fig:noon_shift}.
